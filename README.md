🚀 Marine Ecosystems + Machine Learning = Powerful Insights 🌊🌡️

Thrilled to share some exciting results from my recent work applying machine learning and deep learning to marine heatwaves and coral bleaching prediction:

🔹 Neural Networks for Marine Heatwave Detection
Using deep learning on environmental time-series data, the model achieved:
✅ Test Accuracy: 95.35%
📉 Test Loss: 0.19
This high performance demonstrates the potential of neural networks in capturing complex ocean patterns that drive extreme marine events.

🔹 Random Forest & KNN for Coral Bleaching Severity
Trained on a rich dataset of sea surface temperature, pH, and location-specific features:
🌿 Random Forest Accuracy: 82%
🌱 KNN Accuracy: 61% – highlighting opportunities for future tuning and optimization.

📊 Data preprocessing played a key role in shaping quality inputs, leveraging multi-regional records across years and ocean basins.

💡 This is just the beginning—future iterations will explore advanced ensemble methods and expanded feature sets to further improve predictive performance.
